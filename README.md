# Anaylsis of TMDB

For this project I used Python packages matplotlib, numpy, and pandas. 

This dataset was about movies that were released it contained about 10,000 entries. Although through the cleaning process of this data set it turnted out only half the entires i decided to use and that was because of missing data form columns of revenue and budget.

I looked for correlation from budget and revenue, and created another column for profit. 
Then after that I took the release data of each movie and anaylesd the impact that the month that movie was released had on profit.
