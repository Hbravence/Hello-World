# Hello-World

My name is Hunter Bravence, I am not sure how many people will read this but here's a little bit about me.

I was born and raised in Kansas City, when I was two I got sick and my tonsils blooned up to the point that I was deaf. 
When I was five I had them removed, and then I could hear again. That was a little bit of a set back in life.
I had to go to speech therpy all the way up to my junior year of highschool. Also, I swam competively althrough out my life placing in state my senior year of highschool.
I went to Kansas State universty where I was apart of Fraternity called Delta Chi, I majored in Marketing and sales. My last year of college I work as bouncer/bartender.

After College I breifly worked sales for a great company called Envoy, found out that I didn't like sales to much, and i decide to make career change. Then covid happend and no one was hiring, so I decide to learn programming and fell in love with it. Got certifed in a few things in Kaggle then I decide to do a nano degree through Udacity
